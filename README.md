## Tennis scheduling
Six people share a winter tennis contract that allows four of them them to play each Saturday morning for 30 weeks

Make a fair schedule such that
- Every combination of 4 players is evenly represented
- Everyone plays the same number of times
- No one sits out on consecutive days.
